# Harnessing population-specific protein-truncating variants to improve the annotation of loss-of-function alleles

This repository contains all data and code pertinent to the analysis presented in the paper. This project is dedicated to the identification of population-specific PTVs (psPTVs) and building a predictive model to enhance annotation of low-confidence loss-of-function (LoF) alleles. 

psPTVs are strongly enriched for low-confidence putative LoF (pLoF) variants. An example of a notable psPTV that is a misannotated low-conf pLoF is a rs139297920 in the *PAX3* gene:

`psPTV_project.Rmd` markdown file represents the body of the analysis and contains the complete explanation of all data analysis steps and conclusions.

`LoFfeR` folder contains the source code and reference materials of the **LoFfeR** toolkit that was developed to enhance the annotation of low-confidence pLoF alleles.
